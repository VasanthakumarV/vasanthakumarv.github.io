# Introdution

Probability distributions are a way of describing all possible events and probability of each one happening. Probability distributions are useful for asking questions about ranges of possible values.

# Binomial distribution

Binomial distribution is used to calculate the probability of a certain number of successful outcones, and it involves three parameters:

- The number of outcomes we care about $k$
- The total number of trials $n$
- The probability of the event happening $p$

Probability Mass Function (pmf) for binomial distribution:

$$B(k; n, p) = \binom{n}{k} \times p^k \times (1 - p)^{n - k}$$
