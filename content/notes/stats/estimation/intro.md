# Introduction

Parameter estimation is an essential part of statistical inference where we use our data to guess the value of an unknown variable. The true goal of parameter estimation is not simply to estimate a value, but rather to assign a probability for a range of possible values.

# Normal distribution

The normal distribution is a continuous distribution (like beta distribution) that describe the strength of possible beliefs in the value of an uncertain measurement, given a known mean and standard deviation. The PDF of the normal distribution is:

$$N(\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \times e^{ -\frac{ (x - \mu)^2 }{ 2\sigma^2 } }$$
