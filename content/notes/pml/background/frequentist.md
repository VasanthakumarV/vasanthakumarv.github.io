# Introduction

Bayesian statistics treats parameters of models just like any other random variable, and applies the rules of probability theory to infer them from data. Attempts have been made to devise approaches to statistical inference that avoid treating parameters like random variables, and which avoid the use of priors and Bayes rule. The alternative appraoch is known as __frequentist statistics__, __classical statistics__ or __orthodox statistics__.

The basic idea is to represent uncertainty by calculating how a quantity estimated from data would change if the data were changed. By contrast the Bayesian approach views probability in terms of information rather than repeated trials.
