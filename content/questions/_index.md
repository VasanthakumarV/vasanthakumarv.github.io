__When does the inverse of a function exist?__

Inverse of a function exists when the function is __bijective__ (both injective and surjective exists).
A function is __injective__ when domain and codomain has a _one-to-one_ mapping.
A function is __surjective__ when every element in the codomain maps to an input.
